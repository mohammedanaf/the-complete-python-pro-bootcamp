Flooring a Number

You can floor a number or remove all decimal places using the int() function which converts a floating point number (with decimal places) into an integer (whole number).

int(3.738492) # Becomes 3
"""

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
bmi = 84 / 1.65 ** 2
print(bmi)

print(int(bmi)) # flooring the number or removing all the decimal places

"""
Rounding a Number

However, if you want to round a decimal number to the nearest whole number using the traditional mathematical way, where anything over .5 rounds up and anything below rounds down. Then you can use the python round() function.

round(3.738492) # Becomes 4
round(3.14159) # Becomes 3
round(3.14159, 2) # Becomes 3.14
"""

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
print(round(bmi)) # rounding the number to the next possible whole number

print(round(bmi, 2)) # rounding the number to the next two decimal places

"""
Assignment Operators

Assignment operators such as the addition assignment operator += will add the number on the right to the original value of the variable on the left and assign the new value to the variable.

+=
-=
*=
/=
"""

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
score = 0
score += 1

print(score)

"""
f-Strings

In Python, we can use f-strings to insert a variable or an expression into a string.

age = 12
print(f"I am {age} years old")
# Will output I am 12 years old.
"""

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
username = "Player 0"
score = 7
lives = 2
is_winning = True

print(f"Your name is {username}, your score is {score} and lives left are {lives}. The possibility of your winning is {is_winning}.")
